# Technical background
## Master Thesis
I have written my master thesis about the approach and architecture behind mobo.
I'll call the approach Schema-Driven Development (SDD).

My thesis will explain this approach and proposes an generic SDD architecture.
After those theoretic foundations are laid, the technical implementation and decicions of mobo are explained in more detail.

## Link to Thesis
The thesis is not published yet, but will be shortly.
