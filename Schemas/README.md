# Overview
Mobo defines internal meta-schemas. They describe how the development model schema should be written and validated.

The following schema generation is automatically generated and should always be up to date what the current version of mobo supports and validates:

* [Settings Schema](settings-schema.md)
* [Field Schema](field-schema.md)
* [Model Schema](model-schema.md)
* [Form Schema](form-schema.md)
