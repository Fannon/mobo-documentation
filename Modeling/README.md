# Overview
The following subsections will document:
* A [manual](manual.md), explaining the basics about mobo modeling
* A [tutorial](hardware-tutorial.md), which goes through an exemplary modeling project step by step
* Explanation of the development model [Project Structure](ProjectStructure/).
* A collection of [best/common practices](best-practices.md).

The [Schemas](../Schemas/) Documentation will also be very important for reference. Since it's autogenerated it always reflects the most current state.
