## Description
This directory works similar like /smw_page/. MediaWiki Templates can be stored here without having to prepend `template___`. All templates in this directory will overwrite any template mobo has created before.

Please note that some characters canâ€™t be used for filenames, so some string substitutions have to be made.

* `___` will be substituted with `:` (namespaces)
* `---` will be substituted with `/` (subpages)
